                    To meet the United Nation’s goal of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education we’re going to have to transform education through technology. The most famous technologies in recent years have been machine learning and data analytics which I believe will be important keys to unlocking the potential of many young children who live in areas where there aren’t enough educators, education is poor, hard to access or all of the above.

                <p>
                    We’re already seeing prestigious schools incorporate these technologies and some may argue that adapting to a new educational paradigm making heavy use of data and analytics is an insurmountable task for countries, regions and states that already have issues delivering education, but if they want to catch up then they must look ahead rather than behind, or the gap will remain the same or grow.

                    One of the UN’s main targets is to make sure children finish their education, as the rates of completion have worryingly been stalling in recent years, so It’s important to look at how analytics can help administrators retain children in education. One way administration could take advantage of data is by using data analysis to look for certain variables that could lead to children dropping out, once they have this data, they could visualize it and find common themes among the children who are at risk. It’s believed that collecting and tracking things such as absenteeism, behaviour and academic performance is paramount to stopping children from dropping out of school(Unicef, 2018)

                    </sup>
                    . Using and modelling such data could lead to administrators more readily being able to identify the warning signs and use a predictive function, for instance linear regression, to tackle the issue before it develops.

                    Getting children to stay in school not only helps with the goal of raising school completion rates but could also help with the goal of providing equal education among the sexes as staying in school longer can have a knock-on effect and lead to an increase in gender equality(Unicef, 2018)

                    </sup>
                    . Another way in which administration could benefit from data analysis is by finding optimal places to place schools in remote areas. This may seem unimportant to keeping children in school, but research has shown that “School distance from home is one of the determining factors for students to dropout.”(Dagnew, 2017)
                    <sup id="ref-1" class="reference">
                        <a href="#cite_note-treccani-2">

                    </sup>
                    ; by analysing the populations in such remote areas, it would be easy to find an optimal place for a school to be built where it could serve the most children.

                    As we all learn and retain information in different ways having an education tailor made to your preferred way of learning could help to ensure that children thrive in their studies. Via data analytics, educators could find if their students are visual, auditory, reading/writing, or kinaesthetic learners and present each type of learner with a unique curriculum that will play to their strengths, as an example visual learners need less guidance but need the instructions to be repeated more than the other groups(Muhammad Mujtaba Mitra Zuana et al., 2023)

                        <a href="#cite_note-treccani-2">

                        </a>
                    </sup>
                    . Having an education that played to the students’ strengths could improve their abilities and could even be extended to tailor homework for each learning group.

                    Analysis of test results could find where students are lagging behind their peers. By analysing their work, we can find where they’re falling behind by being able to see which kind of questions they routinely fail on or don’t get quite right. Such insights can allow teachers to laser in on such gaps in knowledge and fill them before they’re faced with vital, life altering exams(Ratcliffe, 2013)
                    <sup id="ref-1" class="reference">
                        <a href="#cite_note-treccani-2">

                        </a>
                    </sup>
                    . By taking tests on computers, you could even analyse how long it takes a student to answer a question. Insights like this could be used to find which questions are giving students problems then further investigation could discover whether it’s from something asinine such as the wording of the question, or more seriously, the content of the question. Analysis of such data would allow teachers to see which children are falling behind, catch them up, and make sure they achieve literacy and numeracy which is another UN target.

                    The UN have found that, in 2020, over 14% of teachers are underqualified according to the national standard and unfortunately, this has been the case for many years(United Nations, 2023)
                    <sup id="ref-1" class="reference">
                        <a href="#cite_note-treccani-2">

                    </sup>
                    , and could be remedied by allowing governments to view the data on student attainment so they can pinpoint people who are unfit to be teaching. Unfortunately, there’s also a severe lack of teachers in certain areas so utilizing data analysis via predictive algorithms, such as linear regression, could be used to find where teachers are most needed in communities.

                    With all this data, students could benefit by readily being able to visualize their own competencies and weaknesses. Being able to visualize their achievements in such a way could empower them to seek further education that will build on their strengths or allow them to work on their weaknesses before they become a crutch. It’s been shown that self-affirmation can lead to greater educational outcomes(Matthew J. Easterbrook et al., 2021)
                    <sup id="ref-1" class="reference">

                    </sup>
                    , so the ability to compare themselves and to see their own progress could have a cumulative effect on their grades. Another goal of the UN is to increase the number of youth who have relevant skills with information and technology, by incorporating data with their education they’ll no doubt pick up some concepts via osmosis, and what better piece of technology to learn than data analysis as in 2021 businesses spent $215 billion on big data(Rohit Amarnath, 2022)

                    This change to the education paradigm may seem over the top and expensive, especially for places with little money, but the money would quickly be earned back by having a qualified and educated workforce that can compete on the world stage and attract global capital. Some of the ideas may seem radical or unachievable but as the UN has said, to meet their goal “education systems must be re-imagined” and what better way than by utilizing cutting edge technologies before they’re obsolete.
